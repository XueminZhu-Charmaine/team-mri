Summary of Mapping Human Whole-Brian Structural Networks with Diffusion MRI

Goal

Understanding the large-scale structural network formed by neurons and to get a detailed connectivity map of entire brain

Mapping a large, comprehensive and individual white matter connectional datasets of the human and animal brain.

Method

Using diffusion MRI of both live and dead human or animal brains

Introduction

Problems
Human brain is too complex to use a graph which consists of neurons and edges to explain.
Irrelevant imformation from the global organization point of view.
Granularity graphs are limited to small post-mortem datasets and people lack a large database of human brain

Method
Using a method derived from dMRI tractography which can map network consisting of nodes representing WGM interfaces and weighted edges between.

Advantages
1. a relatively high resolution: not only to study brain connectivity locally but globally
2. non-invasive method: study to topology of living human brain
3. an individual network for the entire brain: different from "average" brain
4. efficient: an hour or less

Material and Methods
Methods:
1.diffusion MRI acquisition
2.white matter tractography
3.white matter-gray matter interface partition into Regions Of Interest(ROIs)
4. network construction

Results and Discussion
Human brain is a small world but not a scale-free network.
